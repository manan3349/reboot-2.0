# Question 1
## Blocking System call :
###### We have to block the systemcall for date command and firefox.
date
which date
/* 
 * this will give you the location of date.
 * then go to that loc, that is /usr/bin and search date.
 * rename the date file by date21 and save it.
 * then go to that Location /usr/bin/ and create a date file.
 */
 cd /usr/bin
 touch date
 /* 
  * this will create an empty file and the original file is renamed by date21.
  * Now if we do date then it will denied the services.
  */
  cd
  date 
  
  ###### Same for the firefox.
  firefox
  which firefox
/* 
 * this will give you the location of firefox.
 * then go to that loc, that is /usr/bin and search firefox.
 * Open that firefox file and empty the file.
 * By doing this, the kernel will not respond if we click on firefox or by typing in terminal.
 * It shows nothing because we have deleted the script/code.
 */
 
 
 # Question 2
 ## Play with directory
 ###### create a directory without name from command line.
 /*
  * Have to create directory without name  or let say blank.
  * Go to terminal.
  */
  mkdir " "
  /*
   * Giving space between underscores and will create an empty directory.
   * And mkdir is basiclly a command to make a directory.
   * we can see tht blank directory by GUI method, going in file tabs.
   * and by listing files in terminal by ls
   */
   ls
   
   ###### create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
  /*
  * Have to create directory with name "-okgoogle" .
  * Go to terminal.
  */
  mkdir -- "-okgoogle"
  /*
   * This will create a directory with name starting with -okgoogle.
   * we can see tht directory by GUI method, going in file tabs.
   * and by listing files in terminal by ls
   */
   ls
